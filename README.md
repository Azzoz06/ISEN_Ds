### Kaggle
**Kaggle** is an online community of data scientists and machine learners, owned by Google LLC. Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.  
It is a good starting point to learn Data Science through their **Getting Started competitions** and the kernels shared by the community.

### DataCamp
Most of the cheat sheets above come from **DataCamp**  

### CognitiveClass.ai
[CognitiveClass.ai](http://cognitiveclass.ai) is a eLearning web site run by IBM which includes **Journey Path** to become a Data Scientist in Python and/or in R. In addition it includes a series of courses on Big Data, Deep Learning, Hadoop, Kubernetes and so on.  
Some of the courses and journeys will grant you a **Certification Badge**
